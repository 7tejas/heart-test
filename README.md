## Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

The major challenge in heart disease is its detection. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and overall complications. Since we have a good amount of data in todayâ€™s world, we can use various machine learning algorithms to analyse the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data.
The core idea of project is to predict heart diseases using machine learning. I have built a machine learning model and integrated it with a web application. It predicts whether the patient is likely to have heart disease or not.


## Dataset
The dataset has 14 attributes:

 - age: age in years.
 - sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female).
 - cp: chest pain type (Value 0: typical angina; Value 1: atypical angina; Value 2: non-anginal pain; Value 3: asymptomatic).
 - trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
 - chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl.
 - fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
 - restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal; Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; Value 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
 - thalach: maximum heart rate achieved.
 - exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
 - oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
 - slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 0: upsloping; Value 1: flat; Value 2: downsloping).
 - ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.
 - thal: thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect).
 - target: heart disease (1 = no, 2 = yes).


## File Descriptions 

- `data.csv`: the dataset file.
- `Heart_Disease_Classification.ipynb`: contains the code of data exploration, preparation and modeling. 
- `model.pkl`: the classification model. 
- `app.py`: Flask API that bind between the classification model and the web page. 
- templates:
	- `Heart Disease Classifier.html`: a web page that contains a form for heart disease testing.
